Simple end point /api/?search=<string-here>.

Take the querey string create a pandas dataframe with 5 field.
1 . word -> contian the word.
2. count -> word count.
3. word_len -> legth of the entry..
4, word_start -> 0 if querystring word match at start with same row word . else 0,
5, check_word -> 0  if querystring word match any position with same row word. else 0,

Then sort the data frame accordinglly
word_start( ascending ) => word_len(ascending) => word_count(descending) => check_word =>(ascending)

combine shorting will give the expected result. 
then slice the dataframe from top up to index 25.
itrate over the new dataframe and construct a list of dict containg word and count key . 


drawback :

dataset shape is huge view process taking relative amount of time on single thread to read and construct dataframe. 
and If database use to store the dataset the response time increse . cache the dataset no considered .
heroku timeout on 3000ms so . on live 503 error . and on Development as multiple request comes in thread core use reached to 100%.
